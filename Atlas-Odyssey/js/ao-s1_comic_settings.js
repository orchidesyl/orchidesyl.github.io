//comic_settings.js was created by geno7, with much needed assistance from Dannarchy

//this is the main file you'll be messing with to manage and update your comic. most (not all) of the main toggle-able settings are here.

//comic_archive has more settings pertaining to the archive page, and comic_show has settings pertaining to the main place that pages of your comic are displayed.

let pg = Number(findGetParameter("pg")); //make "pg" mean the current page number (this line doesnt work unless I put it here, if you're inexperienced with js dont worry about it)

////////////////////////
//VARIABLES FOR TWEAKING

//REALLY IMPORTANT ONES
const maxpg = 20; //the current number of pages your comic has in total. this DOESNT necessarily mean number of IMAGE FILES as it doesn't count pages split into multiple files. 
//YOU MUST UPDATE THIS NUMBER EVERY TIME YOU ADD A NEW PAGE or else it wont display the most recent page

// COMIC PAGE SETTINGS
const folder = "Atlas-Odyssey/source/comics"; //directory of the folder where you keep all the comics
const image = "OS-AO_"; //what you'll name all your comic pages
const imgPart = "-" //special character(s) you put after the page number to subdivide pages into multiple image files (ie pg2_1, pg2_2, etc)
const ext = "jpg"; //file extension of your comic pages


//NAVIGATION SETTINGS
const navText = ["First","Previous","Next","Last"]; //alt text for your nav images, or just the text that shows up if you're not using images
const navFolder = "Atlas-Odyssey/source/comicnav"; //directory where nav images are stored
const navExt = "png" //file extension of nav images
const navScrollTo = "#showComic"; //id of the div you want the page to automatically scroll to when you click to the next comic. will turn off if you delete text between quotation marks

if (pg == 0) {pg = 1;} //display MOST RECENT COMIC when the webpage is loaded. if you want to instead have the FIRST COMIC displayed first, change maxpg to 1.

//pgData holds all the parameters for each of your pages. copypaste this and fill out accordingly:
/* 
    {
        pgNum: ,
        title: "",
        date: writeDate([YEAR],[MONTH],[DAY]),

        imageFiles: "",
        authorNotes: `<h5>If you want to write an author notes section, this'd be the place to do it.</h5>`,
    },
*/
//Note: the formatting is important! The whole thing won't show up if you forget to include the commas or curly braces in the right place.

//below is a function you dont rly need to mess with but if you're more experienced with js you can
