# Hello, I'm Orchid
I make things. This is home to my projects, artistic experiences, or anything I care to publish on the web. I'm not a fan of the drag and drop website builders, so this is coded from scratch. I'm still learning, especially towards making this fully functional and accessible. I see myself more as artist and designer than programmer. I completed my undergrad at Cooper Union in Art; but Fall 2025 I'll be at Teachers College at Columbia University majoring in Design and Development of Digital Games. By day, I am a public school visual arts educator and teaching artist in studio glass.

Wanna contact me about my coding, development, or programming projects? Send a letter @ dev@orchidesyl.com 

Wanna say hi, or have any questions about my process or work? Contact hello@orchidesyl.com
