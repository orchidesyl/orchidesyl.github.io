      <p><em>Projects in Authorship</em> are a series of workshops incubating autonomous processes at the intersection of art, design, and narrative. <abbr title="Projects in Authorship">PiA</abbr> aims to center developmental and multidisciplinary approaches to creative exploration as storytelling. The series surveys the nature of archive, means, and material exploration as intersectional and referential through research, collective history, and experimentation. Sessions in <abbr title="Projects in Authorship">PiA</abbr> are not meant to teach participants <em>how</em> to be an artist or designer in the conventional sense, but is meant to cement greater thought behind the ways we express ourselves. For this reason, participants don't need to have prior experience in art, craft, or design as emphasis will be placed on exploration, experimentation, and safety.</p>

        <summary>Context</summary>
        <p>Reflecting on my artistic practice as exhibitionist, curator, educator, student, engaged community member, there is an overemphasizing of consumption when it comes to validating <abbr title="Art with a Capital A, as in, visual arts that is high brow, elite, or relative to higher institutions">(A)rt</abbr> or <abbr title="Design with a Capital D, as in, utilitarian projects distinguished from folk decoration">(D)esign</abbr> as distinguished from craft, folk art, and the ethnographic. I reflect on the ethnographic in my engagements with art not only as first generation American and diaspora child of the Afro-Caribbean and exploited world. This represents facets in art and design movements to disproportionately depicting Western canons as intellectual and the global narrative of Asian, African, Oceanic, Indigenous, and Creole diasporas as the fetishized, primitive other. While Newark (like many major cities) has always had a history being culturally and ethnically diverse, the systemic oppression of Black and Latin residents, the ethnic tension among White populations, and the political changes resulting in Newark Riots yielded to a significant loss of industry due to an exodus of the middle class towards surrounding suburbs. Although I am first generation American and have no relatives who experienced life in Newark since the 1960s, there is a through-line in art, education, and cultural activism in people's revolutions. In the way my mother experienced education destabilization in Grenada and my siblings and I experienced the inequality of education in the Newark South Ward, the legacy of visual art and design education at my alma mater Arts High School has been maimed in direct consequence of the defunding, relocation, and closure of the Newark School of Fine and Industrial Art. I am extremely grateful to have the privilege of pursuing my innate passion for art at a young age, but I would not be receptive to the opportunities I've earned without the faith, encouragement, and guidance of loved ones, teachers, practicing artists, and activists as community leaders.</p>
        <p>The scholasticide of education is a shared generational and cross-cultural struggle that comes in many forms. When institutions fail, falter, or are sabotaged, it's up to community to assess, react, provide, and coalesce. The goal of the Projects in Authorship workshop series is to be a transient, community tethered experience not only where experiences are fluid and nonlinear, but participants can curate non-canonized art narratives tailored to addressing their specific needs.</p>

        <h3>Policies and Expectations</h3>
        <p><em>Projects in Authorship</em> is an intensive series making art and design methods radically accessible to the public. <abbr title="Projects in Authorship">PiA</abbr> aims to mitigate the lack of technological and instrumental availability, which includes (but is not limited to) software, hardware, supplies, and time for recreation.</p>
        <p>Experimentation, exploration, and curiosity are at the core of learning. In technical courses such as this, results are a helpful measure of potential, comprehension, and eagerness. However, one's patience for themselves and craft is often influenced by the results of people and things they admire, regardless of experience. Just as it's important to have the courage to create projects that reflect a capability to evolve, it's important ot cultivate an environment that is equitable. <strong><em>There will be no tolerance for harassment of personal charasteristics, such as race, ethnic heritage, gender presentation, sexual orientation, religion, financial background, speech, health status, and disability.</em></strong> For accomodation requests, reports relating to safety, or any additional questions or comments, contact <a href="mailto:edu@orchidesyl.com">edu@orchidesyl.com</a>.</p>

            <summary>Documentation, Process, and Completion</summary>
              <p>By the end of this course, students should have a demonstrative and referencial understanding of fabrication process. Sketching, drafting, and developing ideas are essential to this series. This doesn't just mean drawing, but can also mean figuring out aesthetics, identity, and intention. While it's great to have a plethora of projects students are proud of, learning is the goal, not production. Documentation of work at multiple stages is helpful for reflecting on your own practice. This allows makers in the long term to have a reference point for their own growth and insight to troubleshoot roadblocks in their routine. Practially, having ephemera of educational experiences enables capacities for change in real time. Establishing an archive of autonymous projects, student attribution, and feedback enriches the ever-evolving practice of art and design education.</p>

            <summary>Source Material, References, and Plagarism</summary>
              <p>Plagarism (using someone else's work without prior permission or respect to defined terms), generative <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>, and claiming someone else's work as your own is discouraged. Not only does plagarism and intellectual theft is a gesture of disrespect towards your peers, but it underminds your credibility and stunts your capability as a maker. Workshops will explore mindful resourcing with libraries, archives, and seeking permission.</p>
              <p>Generative AI is controversial for this course because of the unattributed, devaluating of creative labor by artists, whose work is sampled into the models this technology sources from. This is a major reason why creatives online are distancing themselves from entities who unconsentually use their work and obscures options to withdrawl from being included in model training. This ranges from smaller start-ups to Adobe and Meta. <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> itself is a feature of virtual systems. It can be a tool, as in the case for <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr>, game design, and robotics. As with anything, intention and impact are factors people consider for the welfare of their environments.</p>

            <summary>Archiving, Distribution, Documentation, and Recording</summary>
              <h5>Throughout the course of <abbr title="Projects in Authorship">PiA</abbr>, the instructor will take photo, video, and audio recordings during workshops. Live documentation will be used for proof of instructor's community teaching experience and for the promotion of spaces where workshops are held. An archive about <abbr title="Projects in Authorship">PiA</abbr> will include the syllabus, workshop plans, photographic documentation, initial survey responses, and participant feedback. The <abbr title="Projects in Authorship">PiA</abbr> archive will be used as part of the instructor's teaching portfolio and will be shared with organizers, coordinators, and benefactors. Any capturing of likeness, projects made in workshops, or intellectual property will be used solely for the outlined above. Projects made in workshops and intellectual property will be properly credited. Participation in the workshops is an agreement to the above. If involved people, including participants, organizers, contributors, or benefactors, would like to access any recordings or photos, contact <a href="mailto:edu@orchidesyl.com">edu@orchidesyl.com</a>.</h5>

              <h5>Based on demontrated need, students will be able to use tools taught for the course. This includes reservable, shared equipment usable during workshop sessions. There will be time during the course for working on projects. Although specific processes will be focused, participants are free to use their own tools as participation will equip them with fundamental skills and concepts which can be utilized in different contexts. Regardless, to ensure students in current and future workshops have unabridged use of equipment, participants are expected to handle shared tools with respect, whcih includes cleaning, safe handling, and permitted use only.</h5>
              <h5><strong><em>Accidents happen. Creating can be messy.</em></strong> Software crashing and ink spills are simple and common. Students will be guided on preventative measures that avoid the damage of personal property and loss of time. Additionally, there are demonstrations which require tools with exposed heating (material extrusion and platform preparation for 3D printing), sharp edges (scissors, staplers, dip pen nibs), chemistry (acids and salts) or physical strain (sitting or standing for long periods, bright, non-strobing light, manual dexterity). Atendees are instructed and supervised in the careful operation of potentially hazardous material while wearing provided <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> to establish safety, discipline, and build confidence in unfamiliar methods. <abbr title="Projects in Authorship">PiA</abbr> organizers, coordinators, and benefactors believe in good faith that participants respect the space, the instructor, and each other. <strong><em>Anyone who exhibits abusive and threatening behavior in the form of verbal, physical, and sexual harassment will not be permitted to attended any following sessions in this series.</em></strong></h5>
          </details>
        <h5>Understanding of craft and technique requires discipline, mindfulness and care for one another. Participants will be notified of updates throughout the progression of the workshop series to accomodate unexpected events and changes. Enrolling in and endorsing this workshop series is an agreement to all that is outlined above.</h5>
