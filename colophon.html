      <h2>Colophon</h2>
      <p>Thank you to the brilliant minds who made my practice possible.</p>
      <p>I have strongly resonated with my unique name. my first and last names relate to nature (Orchid, the Flower; Sylvester, meaning “of the wild / wilderness” in Latin). To represent myself as an artist of the Caribbean diaspora with research in virtual states and media, I use colors reminiscent of web 2.0, But are still botanical and tropical.</p>
      <p>My Personal interest in media such as animation, games, film, and music overlap with alternative aesthetics of the 70s - 2000s. This coincides with civil unrest, anti-war sentiment, the US Invasion of Grenada (Maternal Culture), and the dawn of the Information Age. These on their own culminate in the faction of humanity, the realization of illness, and capitalism in decay, but in my work exist as visual narrative and industrial craft.</p>
      <p>The design for my icon / Logo is a flower; It is graceful, but has a foreboding quality due to its sharpness and frontal orientation. The angle joints close to its center alludes to fabrication, but is allegorical to my connection to community, to many parts.</p>

      <p>Orchids span the world, but are densest in the tropics. Including my Caribbean heritage, I Research revolutions in “the Global South” as being emblematic of modernity, apocalypse, and agency, similar to how technology is perceive across The Black Atlantic and “the west.” Orchids Embody the duality, which is something I grapple with. existentialism manifests in my art, but so does an optimism for struggle, because daring to struggle is daring to have hope in the future.</p>
